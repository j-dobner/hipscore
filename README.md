code for hipscore machine learning models

The purpose of this repository is to enable access to the code (2024-07-17_ml_code_hipscore.R) which was used to train the machine learning models of the article "Reassessment of Marker Genes in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells for Enhanced Quality Control", published in Nature Communications in 2024 by Dobner et al.
These machine learning models are used to classify human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)-derived early germ layer samples in a combinatorial approach based on binary classification of four individual subtests for each of the early hiPSC differentiation states undifferentiated/pluripotent, endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm. The models have been implemented in a R shiny-based web-application which can be accessed under https://jdobner.shinyapps.io/hipscore/.

If you encounter any problems using the code and/or the web-application, please contact the corresponding author and/or the owner of this repository.
